# RobinhoodTradingBot
This is an example trading bot built using the (unofficial) Robinhood API.  It uses a cash account from Robinhood to get around day trading limits, and will target a provided stock at pre-determined purchase and sell prices.  This is NOT intended to be stock advice in any way, and was just a hobby project for fun.  The code will also recommend buy/sell prices to you based on historical price data, and you can 'test' stocks to see how well they would have performed over the last 30 days using this code's logic.  The recommended buy/sell prices are determined using standard deviation from average of historical price data.  The code will purchase stock in pre-determined dollar amounts when the price falls below the target purchase price and sell when price rises above target sell price.
